# Plug-and-Play Docker Repository

## Overview  
The **Plug-and-Play Docker** (PnP Docker) repository contains custom templates for various software, adhering to core principles:

- **Easy Installation:** Install and run with minimal setup required.
- **User-Friendly Defaults:** Preconfigured settings to cover most use cases.
- **Hassle-Free Setup:** Avoid unnecessary steps, errors, or complex configurations.

While most templates are for third-party applications, I also occasionally release my own software that aligns with the PnP philosophy.

## Templates Included  
- **FileBrowser-PNP**: A web-based file manager offering simple access to your files with minimal setup.  

*(Additional templates will be added soon, covering productivity tools, media apps, and more.)*

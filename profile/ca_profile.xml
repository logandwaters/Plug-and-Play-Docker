  <Profile>I mostly create custom templates for other software, following my Plug-and-Play (PnP) rules—designed to embody the simplicity Unraid apps should offer, with easy installation and minimal tinkering. While my focus is on templates, I also develop my own software occasionally. My goal is to streamline setup so users enjoy hassle-free experiences.</Profile>

  <DonateText>I create software, templates, and tools—both for my projects and to complement others' work. If you find them useful, please consider donating to support my efforts. While I build templates for other software, remember to also support the original creators of the tools you enjoy!</DonateText>
